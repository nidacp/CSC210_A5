Reflection on your experience with this assignment: I had done a similar lab in high school, but the tokenizer worked very differently (there were classes for each operator token, parentheses tokens, and a number token) and we used the stack. This made my initial start to the assignment a bit slower than usual, since I had to try to forget how the previous assignment worked. However, I felt like the instructions were clear enough that I was able to work through this and understand how to complete the lab with this strategy as well.
